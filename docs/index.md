# Home Page

This is a custom template for consumption within DocFX. The documentation includes four principle areas

## Articles

This is where most of the customisation of functionality is included as it is the most manually generated content.

'Articles' are generally hand-written (or generated externally to the DocFX CLI), as opposed to the other areas which are generated based on comments and metadata in source code.
