# REST APIs

This documentation is generated from Swagger (OpenAPI) files.

They have been taken verbatim from the [DocFX seed project](https://github.com/docascode/docfx-seed/tree/master/restapi) as an example. 

In a real-world project, swagger files could be copied over to this folder as part of the post-build doc generation process in a pipeline (or manually copied over, god forbid!)
